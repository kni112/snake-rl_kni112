The changes made while developing pytorch conversion

- Made copy of original agent.py for reference.
- Review model parameters in model_versions.json, version to be used 17.1 according to assignment.
- Review model_config/v17.1.json
- Review agent.py code for an overview, make a plan
- Delete unused model classes from agent.py, retain Agent() and DeepQLearningAgent(Agent) as per assignment "clean the code base".
- Review DeepQLearningAgent class. 
- Clean up some commented out code, removed TF imports.
- Removed functions huber_loss, mean_huber_loss, planning to use Torch modules instead
- Added PyTorch imports and DQN model class(nn.Module) to agent.py with CNN layers added dynamic from config
